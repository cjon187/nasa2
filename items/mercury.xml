		<p>Mercury's eccentric orbit takes the small planet as close as 47 million kilometers (29 million miles) 
		and as far as 70 million kilometers (43 million miles) from the sun. If one could stand on the scorching 
		surface of Mercury when it is at its closest point to the sun, the sun would appear more than three times 
		as large as it does when viewed from Earth. Temperatures on Mercury's surface can reach 430 degrees Celsius
		(800 degrees Fahrenheit). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat,nighttime temperatures 
		on the surface can drop to -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit).

			<b>What Has NASA Learned About Mercury?</b>
Because Mercury is so close to the sun, it is hard to directly observe from Earth except during dawn or twilight. 
Mercury makes an appearance indirectly, however - 13 times each century, observers on Earth can watch Mercury pass
 across the face of the sun, an event called a transit. These rare transits fall within several days of 8 May and 
 10 November. The first two transits of Mercury in the 21st century occurred 7 May 2003, and 8 November 2006. The 
 next are 9 May 2016, and 11 November 2019.

Mercury speeds around the sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 50 kilometers (31 miles) per second
 faster than any other planet. One Mercury solar day equals175.97 Earth days.
