	<title>Graceful Turbulence</title>
	<conbody>
		<p>Powerful magnetic forces above an active region on the Sun twisted
			and pulled at a blob of plasma until it lost its connections and blew
			out into space (Mar. 26, 2014). The resultant swirling presented its
			own kind of graceful, almost ballet-like bends and sweeps. To offer
			some kind of size perspective that blob, before it broke away, was
			easily larger than several Earths. The event was observed in extreme
			ultraviolet light over about 5.5 hours beginning at 7:00 UT. The
			still image was taken at 10:45 UT. Credit: Solar Dynamics
			Observatory/NASA..
