		    <b>Description: </b>
			A planet (from Ancient Greek ἀστὴρ πλανήτης (astēr planētēs), meaning "wandering star") 
			is an astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be 
			rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared
			its neighbouring region of planetesimals
