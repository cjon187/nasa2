		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel,
		although he originally thought it was a comet or star. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 
		84 years to complete one orbit.

			<b>What Has NASA Learned About Uranus?</b>
Black and white image shows Uranus and several moons.	
Uranus and several of its moons in near-infrared.
Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west. Uranus' rotation axis is tilted almost parallel to its orbital plane,
 so Uranus appears to be rotating on its side. This situation may be the result of a collision with a planet-sized
 body early in the planet's history, which apparently radically changed Uranus' rotation. Because of Uranus' 
 unusual orientation, the planet experiences extreme variations in sunlight during each 20-year-long season.
