		<p>Earth is our home planet. Scientists think Earth formed billions of
			years ago. Four planets in the solar system are bigger than Earth.
			Three planets are smaller. It is the third-closest planet to the sun.
			Only Mercury and Venus are closer.Earth has been called the
			"Goldilocks planet." In the story "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," a
			little girl named Goldilocks liked everything just right. Her
			porridge couldn't be too hot or too cold. And her bed couldn't be too
			hard or too soft. On Earth, everything is just right for living
			things. It's warm, but not too warm. And it has water, but not too
			much water.
			Earth is the only planet known to have lots of liquid
			water. Liquid water
			is important for life. Earth is the only planet
			where life has been
			found.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Why Does Earth Have Seasons?</b>
			Earth has seasons because it is tilted. The season depends on whether
			a
			place is tilted toward or away from the sun.
			In the summer, the
			Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun. The
			sun's rays hit the
			Northern Hemisphere in a straight line. The days
			are long and hot. The
			opposite happens in winter. Then, the north is
			tilted away from the
			sun. The days are short and dark. When it is
			summer in the northern
			half of Earth, it is winter in the southern
			half.
		</p>
		<p>Earth is made up of land, air, water and life. Mountains, valleys
			and flat places make up the land. The air is made of different gases.
			One of the gases is oxygen. Oceans, lakes, rivers, streams, rain,
			snow and ice are made of water. Earth has many different kinds of
			life. People, animals and plants live on Earth. Some living things
			are very tiny. Others may be very large.</p>
