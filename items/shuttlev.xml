	<title>Space Shuttle Endevour Launch</title>
	<conbody>
		<p>Endeavour blasted off on the next-to-last shuttle flight Monday
			morning under the command of Mark Kelly, the husband of Rep.
			Gabrielle Giffords. The wounded congresswoman watched the launch in
			private from Kennedy Space Center. As many as 45,000 guests jammed
			NASA's launch site. The crowd outside the gates was estimated to be
			in the tens of thousands, if not more. It was the second launch
			attempt. Late last month, an electrical problem halted the countdown.
			Endeavour and its six astronauts will arrive at the International
			Space Station on Wednesday. They are delivering a $2 billion particle
			physics experiment. The mission will last 16 days. Only one other
			shuttle trip remains.
