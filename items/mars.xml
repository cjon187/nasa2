		<p>Mars is a planet. It is the fourth planet from the sun. It is the
			next planet beyond Earth. Mars is more than 142 million miles from
			the sun. The planet is about one-sixth the size of Earth. Mars is
			known as the Red Planet. It gets its red color from the iron in its
			soil. Mars has two small moons. Their names are Phobos and Deimos.

			<b>What Has NASA Learned About Mars?</b>
			NASA has used both spacecraft and robots to learn more about Mars.
			In
			1965, Mariner 4 was the first NASA spacecraft to get a close look
			at
			the planet. In 1976, Viking 1 and Viking 2 were the first NASA
			spacecraft
			to land on Mars. They took pictures and explored the
			planet's surface.
			Since then,
			more spacecraft have flown near or landed
			on Mars. Scientists want to
			know if
			there is, or has ever been, water
			on Mars. Living things need water to
			survive.
			So, any sign of water on
			Mars would mean that there could be, or could
			have been,
			life on the
			planet.
